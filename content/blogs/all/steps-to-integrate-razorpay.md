### **Uploading a File**

There are three ways you can upload a file:

- From an `Object` instance

- From a `Bucket` instance

- From the `client`

In each case, you have to provide the `Filename`, which is the path of the file you want to upload. You’ll now explore the three alternatives. Feel free to pick whichever you like most to upload the `first_file_name` to S3.
